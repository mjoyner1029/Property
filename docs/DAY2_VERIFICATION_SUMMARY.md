# Day 2 Verification Summary

## Created Resources

1. **Test Plans**
   - `/test_plans/day2_staging_test_plan.md` - Comprehensive test plan
   - `/test_plans/day2_testing_checklist.md` - Detailed checklist for verification

2. **Test Scripts**
   - `/scripts/test_rate_limit.py` - Verifies Flask-Limiter with Redis
   - `/scripts/test_stripe_webhook.py` - Tests webhook signatures and idempotency
   - `/scripts/analyze_csp.py` - Analyzes Content Security Policy configuration
   - `/scripts/test_multi_tenancy.py` - Verifies tenant data isolation
   - `/scripts/test_sentry.py` - Tests error tracking in Sentry

3. **Utilities**
   - `/scripts/run_day2_tests.sh` - Master script to run all tests

4. **Documentation**
   - `/docs/DAY2_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Guide for running tests and interpreting results

## Verification Approach

The Day 2 verification strategy follows a systematic approach:

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Test scripts that verify technical aspects (rate limits, CSP, webhooks)
   - Isolation tests for multi-tenancy
   - Error tracking verification

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Auth flows (register, login, forgot/reset password)
   - Role-based access control
   - CRUD operations for core entities
   - End-to-end payment flows
   - UI/UX verification

3. **Documentation**
   - Checklist for tracking completion
   - Detailed test plans for methodology
   - Guide for executing tests
   - Template for final reports

## Key Focus Areas

1. **Payment Processing**
   - One-time checkout sessions
   - Subscription creation
   - Webhook handling (idempotency and signature verification)
   - Payment state updates

2. **Multi-tenancy**
   - Data isolation across tenants
   - White-labeling capabilities
   - Strict security boundaries

3. **Security & Performance**
   - CSP configuration and violation reporting
   - Rate limiting effectiveness
   - CORS configuration
   - Performance baselines

4. **Monitoring**
   - Sentry integration for error tracking
   - Health check endpoints
   - External uptime monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Update configuration in the test scripts:
   - API and frontend URLs
   - Admin tokens
   - Webhook secrets

2. Run the automated tests:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_day2_tests.sh
   ```

3. Follow the manual testing checklist to verify remaining features

4. Create the final deliverable reports:
   - Payments confirmation report
   - Multi-tenancy verification report
   - Security verification report
   - Monitoring verification report

## Expected Outcomes

Upon successful completion of Day 2 verification:

1. Core business flows will be verified in staging
2. Multi-tenant isolation will be confirmed
3. Security mechanisms (CSP, rate limits, CORS) will be validated
4. Monitoring and alerting will be in place
5. System will be ready for production deployment
