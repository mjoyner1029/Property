# Asset Anchor Disaster Recovery Plan

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for Asset Anchor's production environment.

## Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| Service | RTO | RPO | Criticality |
|---------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Frontend | 1 hour | < 5 min | High |
| Backend API | 2 hours | < 5 min | Critical |
| Database | 4 hours | < 15 min | Critical |
| File Storage | 4 hours | < 30 min | High |
| Email Service | 8 hours | < 1 hour | Medium |
| Payment Processing | 4 hours | < 5 min | Critical |

## Disaster Scenarios and Response Procedures

### Complete Service Provider Outage

#### Render Outage (Backend)

1. **Assessment (0-15 minutes)**
   - Confirm outage via status.render.com and Render support
   - Post initial status update to status page
   - Convene emergency response team in Slack channel #dr-response

2. **Response (15-60 minutes)**
   - Deploy emergency read-only static version of frontend
   - Update DNS to point to static emergency site
   - Communicate estimated resolution time to customers

3. **Recovery (When Render service is restored)**
   - Verify database integrity
   - Deploy backend services with `make deploy-backend`
   - Run health checks with `scripts/verify-deployment.sh`
   - Switch DNS back to normal operation
   - Monitor for any data inconsistencies

#### Vercel Outage (Frontend)

1. **Assessment (0-15 minutes)**
   - Confirm outage via status.vercel.com
   - Test direct API access to confirm backend availability

2. **Response (15-45 minutes)**
   - Deploy emergency frontend to alternate provider:
     ```bash
     # Deploy to backup provider (AWS S3 + CloudFront)
     ./scripts/dr/deploy-emergency-frontend.sh
     ```
   - Update DNS to point to emergency frontend

3. **Recovery**
   - When Vercel service is restored, verify deployment
   - Switch DNS back to normal operation
   - Run smoke tests to verify functionality

### Database Corruption or Loss

1. **Assessment (0-30 minutes)**
   - Identify scope of corruption/loss
   - Determine most recent clean backup
   - Put application in maintenance mode

2. **Response (30-180 minutes)**
   - Restore database from last known good backup:
     ```bash
     # Restore process - to be run by authorized personnel only
     ./scripts/dr/database-restore.sh --backup-id=<BACKUP_ID>
     ```
   - Verify data integrity with validation scripts:
     ```bash
     ./scripts/validate-data-integrity.sh
     ```

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply transaction logs if available
   - Run migration tests
   - Gradually restore services in order:
     1. Read-only API endpoints
     2. Admin functionality
     3. User authentication
     4. Full read-write capabilities

### Ransomware/Security Breach

1. **Assessment (0-60 minutes)**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Engage security incident response team
   - Document evidence of breach

2. **Response (1-8 hours)**
   - Revoke all potentially compromised credentials
   - Take affected systems offline
   - Deploy clean environment from scratch:
     ```bash
     # Deploy clean environment with hardened security
     ./scripts/dr/deploy-clean-environment.sh --security-hardened
     ```

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore data from offline/cold backups only
   - Apply all security patches
   - Run security scans before bringing services online
   - Implement additional monitoring

## Disaster Recovery Testing

### Testing Schedule

| Test Type | Frequency | Last Performed | Next Scheduled |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Tabletop Exercise | Quarterly | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Database Restore | Monthly | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Full Recovery Simulation | Semi-annually | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Backup Validation | Weekly | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD |

### Testing Procedures

#### Database Restore Test

1. Create a staging environment with production-like data
2. Simulate failure by dropping tables
3. Execute restore procedure
4. Validate data integrity
5. Document recovery time and any issues encountered

```bash
# Run automated database recovery test
./scripts/dr/test-database-recovery.sh --environment=staging
```

#### Full Recovery Simulation

1. Set up isolated test environment
2. Deploy application stack
3. Simulate complete infrastructure loss
4. Execute full disaster recovery procedure
5. Measure actual RTO/RPO achieved
6. Update plan based on findings

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups

- **Full Backups**: Daily at 01:00 UTC
- **Incremental Backups**: Every 6 hours
- **Transaction Log Backups**: Every 15 minutes
- **Retention**: 30 days for daily backups, 7 days for incremental

### File Storage Backups

- **S3 Bucket Versioning**: Enabled
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Enabled to secondary region
- **Retention Policy**: 90 days

### Code and Configuration

- **Git Repository**: GitHub with organization backup
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform state with versioning
- **Environment Variables**: Encrypted backup in secure vault
