## Blue/Green Cutover and Rollback Rehearsal

### Cutover Process Summary

The blue/green cutover process follows these steps:

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Run migrations on the live database without affecting the current production application
   - Verify migrations completed successfully

2. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy new backend version to idle production slot
   - Run health checks against new backend version
   - If successful, route traffic to new backend
   - Monitor for errors

3. **Smoke Test**:
   - Run automated smoke tests against new backend to verify core functionality

4. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy new frontend version with updated API endpoints
   - Run health checks against new frontend
   - If successful, route traffic to new frontend
   - Monitor for errors

5. **Final Verification**:
   - Check Stripe webhook functionality
   - Verify security headers
   - Monitor error rates and performance

### Rollback Process Summary

If issues are encountered during cutover, the following rollback procedures are available:

1. **Frontend Rollback**:
   - Use `./scripts/rollback_frontend.sh [DEPLOYMENT_ID]` to restore previous version
   - Verify rollback completed successfully by checking frontend health

2. **Backend Rollback**:
   - Use `./scripts/rollback_backend.sh [SERVICE_ID] [DEPLOY_ID]` to restore previous version
   - Verify rollback completed successfully by checking backend health

3. **Database Rollback**:
   - For schema changes, run down migrations to reverse changes
   - For data changes, restore from backup if necessary

4. **Post-Rollback Verification**:
   - Run smoke tests against rolled back system
   - Verify all integrations are working
   - Monitor error rates to confirm stability

## Rehearsal Checklist

Before each production release:

- [ ] Run blue/green rehearsal on staging environment
- [ ] Practice frontend-only rollback
- [ ] Practice backend-only rollback
- [ ] Practice complete system rollback
- [ ] Document any issues encountered during rehearsal
- [ ] Update rollback scripts if needed
- [ ] Verify all team members understand cutover and rollback procedures
