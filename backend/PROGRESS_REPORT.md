# Progress Report on Backend Fixes

## Completed Fixes

1. **Fixed test_auth_security.py**:
   - Fixed indentation issues
   - All 15 tests in this file are now passing

2. **Fixed Basic Routes**:
   - Root route (/) working correctly
   - API status endpoint (/api/status) returning "online" as expected
   - Both tests pass in test_basic_routes.py

3. **Fixed Authentication Components**:
   - Account lockout logic fixed to use timezone-aware datetimes
   - Password validation logic updated
   - Input validation for login/register endpoints fixed

4. **Rate Limiting Configuration**:
   - Fixed Flask-Limiter v3.x configuration
   - Test setup properly disables rate limiting
   - High limits set for tests to prevent false failures

5. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Added account_fixtures.py with clear_account_locks fixture
   - Updated conftest.py to properly reset account locks and failed attempts cache
   - Fixed test setup for authentication tests

## Remaining Issues

1. **Rate Limiting in Tests**:
   - Despite our configuration fixes, many tests still receive 429 errors
   - Need to further refine how rate limiting is disabled in tests

2. **Test User Indexing**:
   - Many tests use `test_users['role']` syntax, but test_users is a list, not a dictionary
   - Need to update these tests to use proper indexing or convert test_users to a dictionary

3. **User Model Issues**:
   - Model constructors receiving 'token_expiry' which isn't a valid field
   - Need to update User model or remove this parameter from service calls

4. **Missing Routes**:
   - Several 404 errors for expected routes like `/api/users/profile` and `/api/logs/frontend-error`
   - Need to register these routes

5. **Test Environment Issues**:
   - Some tests are failing due to application context issues
   - Several tests failing with authentication-related errors

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Rate Limiting in Tests**:
   - Ensure all rate limiting is properly disabled in test environment
   - Review app.config settings for tests

2. **Update Test User Fixture**:
   - Either convert test_users to a dictionary or update tests to use proper indexing

3. **Fix User Model Issues**:
   - Address 'token_expiry' errors in User model constructor

4. **Register Missing Routes**:
   - Add missing route handlers for user profiles, frontend error logging, etc.

5. **Systematically Fix Test Categories**:
   - Start with authentication and basic routes (already fixed)
   - Move to user management tests
   - Address property and model validation tests
   - Fix service layer tests

## Test Pass Rate

- Passing: 36 tests
- Failed: 48 tests
- Errors: 66 tests
- Skipped: 3 tests
- Total: 153 tests

Current pass rate: 23.5%

## Code Coverage

- Overall coverage: 24%
- Key components with good coverage:
  - User model: 97%
  - Authentication security: 79% 
  - Basic routes: 100%
  - Health routes: 100%

The largest improvements are needed in service layer testing and route handler coverage.
