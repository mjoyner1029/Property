# Frontend Security Improvements

This document summarizes the security improvements implemented in the frontend codebase.

## 1. Memory-First Token Storage

Replaced localStorage token storage with memory-first approach:

- **What**: Created `tokenStore.js` which keeps access tokens in memory only
- **Why**: Prevents XSS attacks from accessing auth tokens via JavaScript
- **Benefits**: Even if an attacker injects scripts, they cannot steal tokens

## 2. Secure API Client

Enhanced the API client with robust error handling and token refresh:

- **What**: Centralized axios configuration, automatic refresh on 401, retry on transient errors
- **Why**: Prevents token mismanagement and improves resilience
- **Benefits**: Consistent auth headers, better error messages, automatic retry on network issues

## 3. HttpOnly Cookie Authentication

Implemented guidance for backend httpOnly cookie usage:

- **What**: Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies, access tokens in memory
- **Why**: Provides defense in depth against XSS and CSRF attacks
- **Benefits**: Short-lived access tokens with secure refresh mechanism

## 4. Consolidated Route Guards

Standardized auth route protection:

- **What**: Consolidated duplicate implementations into single source of truth
- **Why**: Prevents security bypass via inconsistent implementations
- **Benefits**: Simplified code, consistent protection across all routes

## 5. Secure Logging

Replaced direct console.* calls with structured logger:

- **What**: Implemented production-safe logger that prevents PII exposure
- **Why**: Console logging can leak sensitive information in production
- **Benefits**: No-op in production except for errors, consistent log format

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline

Added GitHub Actions workflow:

- **What**: CI pipeline that tests, lints and builds frontend code
- **Why**: Catches security issues before deployment
- **Benefits**: Consistent code quality, security checks on every PR

## 7. Centralized Auth Flow

Refactored login components to use secure authentication:

- **What**: Updated login/logout flows to use centralized auth service
- **Why**: Prevents token mismanagement and ensures consistent security
- **Benefits**: Proper error handling, secure token management

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Update the backend to use httpOnly cookies for refresh tokens (see `/docs/HTTPONLY_COOKIES.md`)
2. **Audit Remaining Console Logs**: Continue replacing any remaining console.* calls with structured logger
3. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for sensitive operations
4. **Content Security Policy**: Add CSP headers to prevent XSS and unsafe resources
5. **Security Headers**: Add security headers in Nginx config and SPA hosting platforms
